                            IHH has been working since 1992 with the purpose of delivering aid to all people who are in need, 
                            who have experienced a catastrophe, who are victims of war, natural disaster, etc. or wounded, crippled, starved, 
                            homeless and persecuted, wherever they are, regardless of their religion, language, race or sect, and to prevent the violation of the basic 
                            human rights and freedoms of those people. 
                            IHH's voluntary relief activities evolved into an official organization in 1995 and spread around five continents 
                            as it established a bridge of goodwill stretching from Turkey to 123 countries.
