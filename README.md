#WorldNgoDay
<hr>

In preparation for World NGO Day, our app pays tribute to some of the many organizations that are helping and comforting the victims of the recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.


The human and economic efforts of these organizations leave a positive impact on the lives of those who are somehow involved with them.


This app (to be replaced with the name of the site) adds to that effort by presenting the user with an overview of the contribution of NGOs in daily life, it focuses on the aid currently being provided in Turkey and Syria and leaves the user the opportunity to join that help through donations.
The NGOs present in our application were chosen at random and with the sole purpose of celebrating their global impact in a general way.


Let's celebrate supporting NGOs!
